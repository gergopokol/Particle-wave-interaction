## Particle-wave-interaction

Mathematica code;

Models the linear phase of an interaction between runaway electrons and high frequency plasma waves.

Parameters.txt -- Physical parameters of the simulation.

Derivatives.txt -- Pre-defined derivatives of the runaway distribution function.

Fitting.txt -- Function that regularizes one of the runaway distributions.

Plasma wave dispersion and runaway distribution can be chosen from 2-2 options:

magnetosonic-whistler and a higher frequency electron-whistler wave; runaway distribution valid in plasma disruptions or in a near-critical electric field. For the resonance condition of the interaction one can use the most general version or a simplified one, valid for ultrarelativistic energies.

The output is the growth rate of the investigated wave due to this interaction, in the pre-defined wave number region.
